This repo contains a rails project which serves as a host for developing a pure ES-6 browser javascript
tool for international telephone input, validation, and normalization, with the following features:

* ES-6:  ES-6 modules are used by default.    Webpack version will be provided at a later date.
* Jslint:  All JS code passes JSlint
* No globals:  No use of the window, document, or other global object
* Re-entrant:  The module can be included and used any number of times without
  interfering or clobbering other instances.
